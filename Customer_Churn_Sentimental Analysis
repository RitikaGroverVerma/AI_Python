 1. Data Sources
- Social Media Data: Facebook, Twitter, Instagram
- Call Detail Records (CDR)
- Customer Support Tickets
- Billing History
- Payment Patterns

 2. Data Ingestion
- Data Ingestion Tools: Apache Kafka, Apache NiFi, or AWS Kinesis for streaming data from various sources.
- Batch Ingestion: For periodic data imports, use tools like AWS Glue or Apache Sqoop.

3. Data Storage
- Data Lake: Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage, or Azure Data Lake for storing raw data.

4. Data Processing and Transformation
- ETL Tools: Apache Spark, AWS Glue, or Databricks for extracting, transforming, and loading data.
- Data Cleaning: Handle missing values, remove duplicates, and normalize data.
- Sentiment Analysis: Use NLP tools and libraries like NLTK, SpaCy, or transformers (BERT, GPT) for sentiment analysis on social media data.

5. Feature Engineering
- Combining Data Sources: Merge and aggregate data from social media, CDR, support tickets, billing history, and payment patterns.
- Feature Extraction: Derive features relevant to churn prediction, such as sentiment scores, frequency of support tickets, payment delays, etc.

6. Data Storage (Post-Processing)
- Processed Data Storage  : Store processed and feature-engineered data in a structured format in data warehouses like Amazon Redshift, Google BigQuery, or Azure Synapse Analytics.

7. Machine Learning
- Model Training: Use platforms like Amazon SageMaker, Google AI Platform, or Azure ML to train churn prediction models.
- Model Evaluation: Assess models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score.
- Model Deployment: Deploy models as APIs using services like AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions  , or Azure Functions.

8. Monitoring and Maintenance
- Monitoring Tools: Use tools like Prometheus, Grafana, or AWS CloudWatch for monitoring model performance and data pipeline health.
- Model Retraining: Set up automated retraining pipelines to keep models updated with the latest data.

9. User Interface
- *Dashboard*: Create dashboards using tools like Tableau, Power BI, or custom web applications to visualize churn predictions and related metrics.
