### Case Study: Customer Churn Prediction in Telecom A

#### Slide: Case Study - Customer Churn Prediction

*Challenge:*
Telecom Company A was facing a high customer churn rate, with approximately 20% of its customer base leaving each year. This resulted in significant revenue losses and increased acquisition costs as the company continuously sought new customers to replace those who left.

*Objective:*
The primary objective was to reduce the churn rate by identifying at-risk customers early and implementing targeted retention strategies.

*Solution:*
The company decided to leverage Business Intelligence (BI) and predictive analytics to address the issue. The steps taken included:

1. *Data Collection:*
   - *Customer Data:* Demographics, usage patterns, service plans, and customer support interactions.
   - *Behavioral Data:* Call detail records (CDRs), internet usage, and service usage frequency.
   - *Transactional Data:* Billing history, payment patterns, and contract details.

2. *Data Preparation:*
   - Data cleaning and preprocessing to handle missing values and inconsistencies.
   - Feature engineering to create relevant variables such as average monthly usage, number of support calls, and payment delays.

3. *Model Building:*
   - Using machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests to build predictive models.
   - Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets to validate the model's accuracy.
   - Evaluating models based on metrics like precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.

4. *Implementation:*
   - The best-performing model was integrated into the companyâ€™s CRM system.
   - The model provided a churn probability score for each customer, updated monthly.

5. *Actionable Insights:*
   - Customers with high churn scores were flagged for proactive retention efforts.
   - Personalized offers, discounts, and engagement campaigns were created based on individual customer profiles.

6. *Monitoring and Optimization:*
   - Continuous monitoring of model performance and recalibration as necessary.
   - Regular updates to the dataset and retraining of the model to adapt to changing customer behavior.

*Results:*
- *Reduction in Churn Rate:* The churn rate was reduced from 20% to 15% within the first year of implementation.
- *Increased Customer Retention:* Targeted retention strategies resulted in a 10% increase in customer retention.
- *Revenue Growth:* The reduction in churn translated to a significant increase in revenue, as the cost savings from retaining existing customers outweighed the costs of acquiring new ones.
- *Customer Satisfaction:* Improved customer satisfaction and loyalty due to personalized engagement and timely interventions.

*Conclusion:*
Leveraging BI and predictive analytics allowed Telecom Company A to effectively identify and mitigate customer churn. This case study highlights the importance of data-driven decision-making in addressing complex business challenges within the telecom industry.


====================================================ALGORITHM For LOGISTIC REGRESSION================================================================================================================

Logistic regression is a popular and effective algorithm for binary classification problems, such as customer churn prediction. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to build a predictive model for customer churn using logistic regression in Python.

### Step-by-Step Guide

#### 1. Import Required Libraries

python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, precision_score, recall_score, f1_score, roc_auc_score, confusion_matrix
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns


#### 2. Load and Inspect Data

python
# Load data
data = pd.read_csv('customer_data.csv')

# Inspect the first few rows
print(data.head())

# Check for missing values
print(data.isnull().sum())


#### 3. Data Preprocessing

##### Handle Missing Values

python
# Fill missing values with 0 or appropriate methods
data.fillna(0, inplace=True)


##### Feature Engineering

Create relevant features for your model. For example:

python
# Example feature engineering
data['total_spent'] = data['monthly_charges'] * data['tenure']

# Convert categorical variables to dummy variables
data = pd.get_dummies(data, columns=['gender', 'contract_type', 'payment_method'], drop_first=True)


##### Label Encoding

Create the target variable:

python
# Define the target variable
data['is_churned'] = data['churn'].apply(lambda x: 1 if x == 'Yes' else 0)

# Drop unnecessary columns
features = data.drop(columns=['customer_id', 'churn', 'is_churned'])
target = data['is_churned']


#### 4. Split Data into Training and Testing Sets

python
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(features, target, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)


#### 5. Model Training

python
# Create and train the logistic regression model
model = LogisticRegression(max_iter=1000)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)


#### 6. Model Evaluation

##### Predict and Evaluate

python
# Make predictions
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
y_prob = model.predict_proba(X_test)[:, 1]

# Evaluation metrics
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
precision = precision_score(y_test, y_pred)
recall = recall_score(y_test, y_pred)
f1 = f1_score(y_test, y_pred)
roc_auc = roc_auc_score(y_test, y_prob)

print(f'Accuracy: {accuracy:.2f}')
print(f'Precision: {precision:.2f}')
print(f'Recall: {recall:.2f}')
print(f'F1 Score: {f1:.2f}')
print(f'ROC AUC: {roc_auc:.2f}')

# Confusion Matrix
conf_matrix = confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred)
sns.heatmap(conf_matrix, annot=True, fmt='d', cmap='Blues')
plt.xlabel('Predicted')
plt.ylabel('Actual')
plt.title('Confusion Matrix')
plt.show()


#### 7. Interpretation and Insights

##### Coefficients Interpretation

python
# Feature importance
coefficients = pd.DataFrame(data={'Feature': X_train.columns, 'Coefficient': model.coef_[0]})
coefficients = coefficients.sort_values(by='Coefficient', ascending=False)
print(coefficients)
